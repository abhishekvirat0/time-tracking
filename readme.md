Files contain:
    
    1. User Authentication
    2. User Teams

For User Authenticatio --> used JWT Token to verify user,

For Database optimization - Added Index to Models 
        `(As indexing costs you additional writes and storage space, so if your application requires more insert/update operation, you might want to use tables without indexes, but if it requires more data retrieval operations, you should go for indexed table.)`
